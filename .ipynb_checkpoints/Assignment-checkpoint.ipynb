settlement within the british empire unlike the older colonies on australias eastern seaboard there were no convicts. and this commitment a free settlement was fiercely maintained. historians are divided about the lasting impact of the absence of the convict taint on the provinces society and culture. butan awareness of difference distinguishes south australians this day. south australia was also created initially as a commercial and administrative partnership between the british government represented in the office of the governor and the south australian colonization commission the precise distribution of administrative powers between these two groups was never adequately defined and constant conflict between them marked the early years of settlement. further complicate matters some members of the colonization commission had formed a joint stock company in raise sufficient funds in land sales satisfy the british government that the new settlement was viable. the south australian company became in effect the financial basis of the new settlement. building much of the early infrastructure and providing banking and other financial services. in the first three vessels

systematic colonisation south australia is often described as a planned settlement. some have called it a social laboratory. an attempt build an improved colony in a nineteenth century sense. it developed from the widespread critique of other colonizing ventures current in liberal circles in britain in the and thirties. most famous perhaps was edward gibbon wakefield whose letter from sydney actually penned while he was confined in newgate prison in outlined many of the principles of systematic colonisation that were guide the creation of south australia. principal amongst these were a commitment free settlement. the belief that land should bought not granted. and bought at a sufficient price both ensure an adequate supply of labour by preventing potential labourers from acquiring land too quickly. and provide the funds for assisted emigration.there was alsoa preference for young. fit families as assisted emigrants.to ensurea balance of the sexes. a south australian association formed in december actively promoted the creation of such a colony in south australia. its members included many who wereactiveadherents ofvarious dissenting sects and were influenced by prevailing radical and utilitarian ideas. robert gouger a friend of wakefields. was a prominent member. as was robert torrens leading members of the association later became board members of the south australian colonization commission protestant sects that had separated from the established church or church of england for a range of theological reasons. dissenters continued very influential in the

a speech delivered at our recent parliamentary friends of dementia event in canberra. dementia advocate kevyn morris discusses the road an mci diagnosis. its impact. and improvements he would like see made the health care system in the future. what if you couldnt remember how you got here. do you know the person next you. are you sure. for many. this is an everyday occurrence. all through our lives we have spectacular years that stand out in our memories. your first job. car. girlfriend. getting married or the birth of a child. was one of those memorable years for me. by then. i was in my midfifties. our children had all left home and were well on their ways with their lives. we had reached that time in our lives where we were supposed enjoy ourselves. we had turned our hands successfully designing and producing handmade tasmanian huon pine furniture and art. with our works being sold throughout the world. by then. my wife leeanne and i had moved wodonga in order establish a mainland outlet for our pieces. as we had been successful in tasmania. for some time. even before we had left tasmania. what started out as every now and then. was the kids more often saying. but dad. we told you it was slow. barely noticeable. but then leeanne began notice an increase in the number of things i wouldnt remember. she tried get our doctor in tasmania listen. but i was too young have memory issues at my age. i was maybe it was just as that old joke said ... women can multitask. where men can do only one thing at a time ... but we do it very well the joke ended around july august of that year for us. what started with me not remembering a few things. ended when i couldnt remember how use a piece of equipment i had used for more than a decade. however. tell someone you forget things and the response is. you look alright ... i do that all the time get some medical people acknowledge there is an issue can a hard road. we hadnt had much luck with the two gps. the endocrinologist or the psychologist we had seen in tasmania. now i would get cranky and snap at leeanne and the kids when i couldnt remember things. like the name of an item or equipment. or even conversations with people on the phone. when leeannes mum was in hospital. her dad rang me and i only remembered tell her three days later. but worse for me was that i would have trouble finding words in my mind or losing my train of thought in a conversation. luckily our doctor listened leeanne when she dragged me into his surgery one day. she said that there was something wrong with me and we need find out what. otherwise ill choke him. it still took nearly three months even get an appointment with the public mental health unit in albury. wodonga doesnt have its own like many country towns that dont have the wide array of health services and professionals that are taken for granted in the cities. the worry of not knowing. with all kinds of things running through my mind. was made worse after an appointment with the neuropsychologist due a lack of information or support. for those who dont have a cognitive impairment. tasks that most of you would find simple and easy. someone with a cognitive impairment will find difficult. confusing and sometimes completely overwhelming. over time i have learned that living with this condition doesnt mean the end of who you are. i cant say how or if an early diagnosis and support would have changed things for us. but i have five suggestions i think will make things easier for others. a maximum wait time of no more than days for initial testing and diagnosis. an introductory package containing information on support. equipment. service providers and government services. should handed the person with the diagnosis and their family. so it takes away the uncertainty of what do. immediate access counselling and support services after a confirmed diagnosis. for government requirements simplified and streamlined. i get an email thats got nine or ten paragraphs. and by the time i get into the fourth line. i dont want read any more. for staff fully trained not only assist people. but have patience with those that are living with these conditions and help the family ease transition. because you go from being kevyn kevyn with mci. kevyn with dementia or kevyn with alzheimers disease. there are thousands of people throughout australia who have a cognitive impairment such as mci. dementia or alzheimers disease. in most cases. cognitive impairments are generally not genetic and are not handed down through the family. however. there are exceptions the rule. what these conditions dont do is pick and choose the patient. they care not for your education or your social status or where you live. they do not discriminate. the changes can subtle. or so fast you wont realise it. therefore. it is imperative that groups such as dementia australia and dementia alliance international are fully funded. it is imperative that the organisations receive guaranteed. ongoing support. this will allow them continue research. provide counselling. assistance and support for those who need it. no matter how hard i try. i cant make you see or understand. i cant teach you what it means have a cognitive impairment. one day. you may wake and find you are me. only then will you understand. but by then it is too late. main navigation home information about dementia about you resources risk reduction support national dementia helpline counselling recently diagnosed family and carers younger onset dementia
