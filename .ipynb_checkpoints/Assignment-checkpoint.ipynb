are you sure for many this is an everyday occurrence all through our lives we have spectacular years that stand out in our memories your first job car girlfriend getting married or the birth of a child was one of those memorable years for me by then i was in my midfifties our children had all left home and were well on their ways with their lives we had reached that time in our lives where we were supposed to enjoy ourselves we had turned our hands successfully to designing and producing handmade tasmanian huon pine furniture and art with our works being sold throughout the world by then my wife leeanne and i had moved to wodonga in order to establish a mainland outlet for our pieces as we had been successful in tasmania for some time even before we had left tasmania what started out as every now and then was the kids more often saying but dad we told you it was slow barely noticeable but then leeanne began to notice an increase in the number of things i wouldnt remember she tried to get our doctor in tasmania to listen but i was too young to have memory issues at my age i was maybe it was just as that old joke said ... women can multitask where men can do only one thing at a time ... but we do it very well the joke ended around july august of that year for us what started with me not remembering a few things ended when i couldnt remember how to use a piece of equipment i had used for more than a decade however tell someone you forget things and the response is oh you look alright ... oh i do that all the time to get some medical people to acknowledge there is an issue can be a hard road we hadnt had much luck with the two gps the endocrinologist or the psychologist we had seen in tasmania now i would get cranky and snap at leeanne and the kids when i couldnt remember things like the name of an item or equipment or even conversations with people on the phone when leeannes mum was in hospital her dad rang me and i only remembered to tell her three days later but worse for me was that i would have trouble finding words in my mind or losing my train of thought in a conversation luckily our doctor listened to leeanne when she dragged me into his surgery one day she said that there was something wrong with me and we need to find out what otherwise ill choke him it still took nearly three months to even get an appointment with the public mental health unit in albury wodonga doesnt have its own like many country towns that dont have the wide array of health services and professionals that are taken for granted in the cities the worry of not knowing with all kinds of things running through my mind was made worse after an appointment with the neuropsychologist due to a lack of information or support for those who dont have a cognitive impairment tasks that most of you would find simple and easy someone with a cognitive impairment will find difficult confusing and sometimes completely overwhelming over time i have learned that living with this condition doesnt mean the end of who you are i cant say how or if an early diagnosis and support would have changed things for us but i have five suggestions i think will make things easier for others a maximum wait time of no more than days for initial testing and diagnosis an introductory package containing information on support equipment service providers and government services should be handed to the person with the diagnosis and their family so it takes away the uncertainty of what to do immediate access to counselling and support services after a confirmed diagnosis for government requirements to be simplified and streamlined i get an email thats got nine or ten paragraphs and by the time i get into the fourth line i dont want to read any more for staff to be fully trained to not only assist people but have patience with those that are living with these conditions and to help the family to ease transition because you go from being kevyn to kevyn with mci kevyn with dementia or kevyn with alzheimers disease there are thousands of people throughout australia who have a cognitive impairment such as mci dementia or alzheimers disease in most cases cognitive impairments are generally not genetic and are not handed down through the family however there are exceptions to the rule what these conditions dont do is pick and choose the patient they care not for your education or your social status or where you live they do not discriminate the changes can be subtle or so fast you wont realise it therefore it is imperative that groups such as dementia australia and dementia alliance international are fully funded it is imperative that the organisations receive guaranteed ongoing support this will allow them to continue to research provide counselling assistance and support for those who need it no matter how hard i try i cant make you see or understand i cant teach you what it means to have a cognitive impairment one day you may wake up and find you are me only then will you understand but by then it is too late main navigation home information about dementia about you resources risk reduction support national dementia helpline

approach to combat devastating impact of climate change nov rising temperatures will lead to dramatic changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather in australia according to a report released today by australias largest general insurer iag and the us national center for atmospheric research ncar the report severe weather in a changing climate includes the latest data on the state of the climate and predictions on future extreme weather events based on a range of warming global temperatures up to from preindustrial times the report provides numerous projections for australias future climate revealing higher intensity tropical cyclones will affect south east queensland and north east new south wales over longer periods of time refer to infographic bushfire risk is likely to increase in almost all states leading to more frequent and extreme heat and longer fire seasons particularly in south east australia regions in new south wales and victoria are likely to be impacted by more damaging hail or greater including areas between hunter river south through to the southern new south wales highlands as well as central and eastern victoria intense rainfall is expected to increase almost everywhere in australia resulting in more frequent flooding in urban areas and in small river catchments sea levels are rising around australia increasing the risk of floods impacting coastal systems buildings and infrastructure iag managing director and ceo peter harmer said there is an urgent need for australia to prepare for and adapt to climate change each year we are confronted globally with extreme weather events that become natural disasters this report shows that our climate is changing more rapidly than some have predicted so it is critical there is a coordinated national approach from governments industries and businesses to build more resilient communities and reduce the impact of disasters iag executive manager natural perils mark leplastrier said the report highlights that one of the key risks facing australia as the world warms towards is tropical cyclones travelling further south with higher intensity this means that parts of south east queensland and north east new south wales will start to experience greater devastation from strong winds and torrential rainfall due to cyclones these regions are denselypopulated and to safeguard these communities now and into the future there needs to be greater investment across all sectors to reduce the financial and physical burden as the climate warms mr leplastrier added the findings highlight the need for resilience and mitigation planning by individuals and communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change with the annual economic cost of natural disasters predicted to hit billion by we need to invest more as a nation to better protect communities this includes adequate land planning and building codes to ensure our infrastructure is able to withstand extreme weather especially for cyclone and floodprone regions mr leplastrier said ncar director for capacity center for climate and weather extremes cindy bruyre said climate change is becoming a major risk multiplier generating more extreme weather events that threaten life and property and weaken economic growth it is imperative that we work together to better understand these risks so society can take appropriate steps to mitigate the potential impacts iag and ncar are currently working on a joint project to apply the latest climate modelling to better understand how tropical cyclones will change in the future this work will be released through peerreviewed journal articles in see all information about the report about ncar the us national center for atmospheric research was established by the national science foundation in to provide the university community with worldclass facilities and services that were beyond the reach of any individual institution ncar s researchers and engineers work with community collaborators and private and public partnerships to ensure that we meet the demands of today s greatest scientific challenges ncar scientists also delve into fundamental research questions producing a wealth of scientific publications that help lead the way for the broader science community ncar is managed by the university corporation for atmospheric research a nonprofit

administrators who following an urgent review closed three out of four plants with the loss of over jobs with the axe hanging over the head of the last plant in wacol brisbane with another jobs at stake these numbers do not include a substantial number of contractors and related suppliers of goods and services after establishing itself as one of australia leading wind tower manufacturers the company has suffered from inconsistent application of the renewable energy certification recs scheme which has either provided a feast or famine and is devastated by news of two current major wind towers contracts being sourced from china and korea seventy five percent of the gullen range wind towers being built by goldwind australia will come from china while we are being told that the mount mercer wind towers being built by repower australia for meridian energy will also be coming from overseas asi national manager industry development ian cairns said the australian government promise of green manufacturing jobs from the renewable energy sector as a result of carbon tax reinvestment has in fact not eventuated for the australian steel industry we are losing them not gaining them ironically industry minister greg combet reinforced the growth of green manufacturing jobs while visiting the rpg plant in adelaide last year. he said australian steel fabrication capability is already being damaged by the effect of the artificial suppression of the chinese yuan the high australian dollar and government subsidisation of the chinese steel industry a point that has recently been acknowledged in europe and the us in recent antidumping cases whilst we have supported the government recent decision to make local industry participation plans compulsory for all clean energy finance corporation funded projects there is little or no work expected to flow from this for some time. mr cairns said the government should be applying similar conditions to all renewables projects immediately as ultimately it is the australian public that will be subsidising these projects as we strive to meet the renewables energy target of percent by the least we can expect out of this is the retention of skilled jobs developed nations like canada the united states many parts of europe even ukraine support their local renewables industries as it is considered in their national interest we call on our government to review the policies of those nations and act immediately to deliver on its promise of green manufacturing jobs before more skilled jobs and vitally important training
